Overview üß≠
This repository hosts a set of programming exercises focused on strings and related data structures. The work was completed as part of the Foundations of Computer Science course during a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Catania. The exercises cover core ideas in imperative programming with C, including string manipulation, memory management, and fundamental data structures. You will find practical implementations, explanations, and smaller projects that blend theory with hands-on coding.

What you will learn üöÄ
- How to reason about strings in C, including null-terminated arrays and dynamic memory.
- How to implement basic string operations from scratch without relying solely on the standard library.
- How to manage memory safely to avoid leaks and undefined behavior.
- How to design simple data structures that work well with strings.
- How to reason about complexity, performance, and correctness in practical code.
- How to debug, test, and verify string functionality across multiple scenarios.
- How to document your work clearly so others can follow along.

Repository structure üóÇÔ∏è
- docs/ ‚Äî notes and explanations for concepts covered in the exercises.
- src/ ‚Äî core C source files for the exercises.
- include/ ‚Äî header files that declare shared interfaces used by multiple exercises.
- tests/ ‚Äî unit tests and sample test harnesses to validate behavior.
- assets/ ‚Äî example inputs, test data, and tiny helper resources.
- tools/ ‚Äî scripts for building, running tests, and formatting code.
- README.md ‚Äî this document.

Getting started ‚öôÔ∏è
Prerequisites
- A C compiler that supports C11 or later (GCC, Clang).
- Make or an equivalent build system for running a build script.
- A POSIX-compatible shell for running scripts (bash on Linux/macOS, Git Bash on Windows works too).

Initial steps
- Clone the repository to your machine.
- Inspect the folders to understand how exercises are organized.
- Pick an exercise you want to explore and start with the corresponding file in src/.

What you‚Äôll typically do
- Read the exercise description in docs or within the source file.
- Write small, focused functions that operate on C strings.
- Compile your code and run small tests manually first, then with the test suite.
- Iterate to improve clarity, correctness, and efficiency.

Building and running exercises üß∞
If a Makefile exists
- make all ‚Äî builds all exercises.
- make test ‚Äî runs the test suite.
- make clean ‚Äî cleans build artifacts.

If there isn‚Äôt a Makefile
- Each exercise typically has a main.c or a harness you can compile directly:
  - gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c11 -o bin/exercise_name src/exercise_name.c
  - ./bin/exercise_name sample_input.txt
- For debugging, compile with extra flags:
  - gcc -g -O0 -Wall -Wextra -std=c11 -o bin/exercise_name src/exercise_name.c

Running individual exercises
- Look under tests/ for example invocations and expected outputs.
- You can feed input via redirection:
  - ./bin/exercise_name < assets/input1.txt
- If an exercise requires command-line options, the usage is documented in the source comment or docs/.

Recommended workflow
1) Start by reading the problem statement in the exercise file or documentation.
2) Sketch a plan that minimizes complexity while meeting the requirements.
3) Implement small, testable components first.
4) Compile and run with representative inputs; observe outputs.
5) Use a minimal set of tests first before expanding coverage.
6) Add comments to explain tricky logic or design decisions.
7) Run the full test suite, then review any failures and fix them.
8) Document your approach and any trade-offs you made.

Core topics and algorithms üß©
Strings in C are a fundamental building block in many programs. This repository emphasizes solid programming practices that translate beyond any single task. Below is a curated map of the topics you will encounter, with succinct explanations and practical notes.

Null-terminated strings and memory management
- C strings are arrays of char ending with a null terminator ('\0').
- Functions often operate in-place to reduce memory usage, but this requires careful handling to avoid overwriting data.
- Buffer sizes matter. Always allocate space for the string, its terminator, and an extra margin for growth in concatenation or tokenization tasks.
- Common pitfalls include off-by-one errors, not allocating space for the terminator, and forgetting to NULL-terminate after operations.

String length, copy, and concatenation
- Implementations should be robust against buffer overflows.
- Prefer safe variants or explicit bounds checking when possible.
- In many exercises, you‚Äôll recreate basic operations such as strlen, strcpy, and strcat to understand how they work under the hood.
- Practice with overlapping memory in copy operations to understand the differences between memmove and memcpy.

Comparison and search
- strcmp, strncmp, and the concept of lexicographic ordering appear frequently.
- Implement substring search using a simple approach and then explore more advanced methods like the Knuth-Menon-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for linear-time matching in practice.
- Character classification can be implemented with simple checks (e.g., isalpha, isdigit) or through manual ranges for portability.

Tokenization and parsing
- Splitting a string into tokens is a common task in compilers, interpreters, and data processing.
- Writing your own tokenizer helps you understand state machines and the importance of delimiters.
- Be mindful of edge cases: consecutive delimiters, delimiters at boundaries, and empty tokens.

Substring extraction and modification
- Extracting a substring from a string involves careful pointer arithmetic and memory allocation.
- When modifying strings, ensure you don‚Äôt corrupt adjacent memory and that you always allocate enough space for the resulting string.

Palindromes and pattern recognition
- Checking for palindromes tests symmetry in strings.
- Implement both case-sensitive and case-insensitive versions to broaden utility.
- Pattern recognition exercises often require efficient scanning and careful bounds checking.

Memory management patterns
- Dynamic allocation and deallocation are core to safe C programming.
- Track ownership: who is responsible for freeing memory?
- Avoid memory leaks by pairing every malloc with a corresponding free.
- Guard against dangling pointers by nulling after free when practical.

Error handling strategies
- Return codes are a clean way to signal success or failure.
- Document all error conditions clearly so callers know what to expect.
- In the tests, verify that both success and failure cases are handled gracefully.

Data structures you‚Äôll use üß±
- Arrays: fixed-size or dynamic arrays for storing characters and tokens.
- Linked lists: useful for dynamic sequences of strings where insertions and deletions occur.
- Stacks and queues: for managing intermediate results in parsing tasks.
- Simple hash-like structures: for quick lookup or counting occurrences within a constrained scope.
- Memory pools: small custom allocators in some exercises to reduce fragmentation and fragmentation risk.

Code organization guidelines
- Separate concerns: put core logic in dedicated functions or modules, keep I/O separate.
- Use header files to declare interfaces shared across modules.
- Keep function lifetimes clear: avoid returning pointers to stack-allocated data.
- Favor small, composable functions with clear responsibilities.
- Document interfaces with concise comments describing inputs, outputs, and side effects.

Debugging and testing üß™
- Use gdb to step through code, inspect variables, and verify function behavior.
- Run with -g -O0 to make debugging easier, then recompile with optimizations when you‚Äôre ready.
- Valgrind helps detect memory leaks and misuses. Run:
  - valgrind --leak-check=full ./bin/exercise_name
- Unit tests verify correctness across diverse inputs. The tests directory holds harnesses and sample cases.
- Use assertions to catch invariants during development, but remove or guard them for production builds if necessary.

Contributing to this project ü§ù
- Start by reading the CONTRIBUTING.md (if present) or follow these general rules:
  - Fork the repository and create a feature branch for your changes.
  - Keep changes focused and small. One exercise per branch is a good rule.
  - Add or update tests to cover new behavior.
  - Document design choices and edge cases in code comments and in the PR description.
  - Follow the existing coding style and formatting conventions.
- How to run your contribution locally:
  - Build the project with the standard build commands described above.
  - Run tests to ensure your changes don‚Äôt break existing functionality.
  - Use a clean environment to replicate the result as closely as possible.

- Use meaningful variable names and keep functions small.
- Separate memory allocation from logic where possible.
- Document edge cases and assumptions in comments.
- Write tests that reflect both typical and boundary scenarios.

Header and source organization
- include/strings.h ‚Äî interface for string operations shared across exercises.
- src/strings_basic.c ‚Äî basic string utilities (length, copy, compare).
- src/strings_tokenize.c ‚Äî tokenization utilities.
- src/strings_palindrome.c ‚Äî palindrome checks.
- src/strings_dynamic.c ‚Äî dynamic memory handling for growing buffers.
- src/main_exercises.c ‚Äî optional main files to run selected exercises.
- tests/ ‚Äî unit tests harnesses and sample inputs.

Examples and code snippets
- Demonstrations are kept compact and readable.
- Functions use clear parameter names and explicit sizes to prevent misuse.
- Memory management is explicit: every allocation has a corresponding free.

Sample function: safe_strlen
- Purpose: Determine string length without overrunning memory.
- Signature: size_t safe_strlen(const char* s, size_t max_len);
- Behavior: Returns the number of characters before '\0', but will not read past max_len.
- Rationale: Protects against non-null-terminated inputs.

Code (illustrative, not copied from any specific exercise)
- Note: This snippet is for educational illustration and may be adapted to the exercises in this repository.

#include <stddef.h>

size_t safe_strlen(const char* s, size_t max_len) {
  if (!s) return 0;
  size_t i = 0;
  while (i < max_len && s[i] != '\\0') {
    ++i;
  }
  return i;
}

Troubleshooting common issues üõ†Ô∏è
- Segmentation faults: check pointer validity and ensure you don‚Äôt read past allocated memory.
- Buffer overflows: always allocate space for the terminator and consider extra padding for concatenation.
- Memory leaks: track every allocation with a corresponding free; use tools like valgrind to detect leaks.
- Off-by-one errors: carefully reason about array indexes and terminator placement.

Testing and quality assurance üß™
- Unit tests: designed to cover normal, boundary, and error conditions.
- Integration tests: exercise combinations of string operations in real-world-like flows.
- Performance tests: though not the primary focus, basic timing checks help catch obvious inefficiencies.
- Continuous improvements: as new exercises get added, tests should be extended to maintain coverage.

Usage examples in practice üß≠
- A typical workflow starts with constructing an expected string in a test, performing an operation, and comparing results.
- For exercises that manage input, build a small harness that feeds strings and prints results for manual verification.
- Use a consistent testing interface so new contributors can quickly add tests.

Documentation and style guidelines üóíÔ∏è
- Every public function has a brief description: purpose, inputs, outputs, and side effects.
- Parameter names reflect their role (e.g., src, dst, max_len).
- Avoid magic numbers; define constants for sizes and limits.
- Style choices aim for readability and maintainability:
  - Short functions with single responsibilities.
  - Clear control flow and minimal nesting.
  - Consistent formatting and indentation.
